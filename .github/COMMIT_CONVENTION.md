# Git Commit Message Convention
We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. This leads to more readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history.

## Commit Message Format
Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**. The header has a special
format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 72 characters! This allows the message to be easier
to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

The footer should contain a [closing reference to an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) if any.

Samples: (even more [samples](https://github.com/flextype/flextype/commits/master))

### Revert
If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

### Type
The type of the made changes. Should be one of:
* **feat** - some feature development
* **fix** - bug fix
* **docs** - changes in documentation
* **style** - changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **refactor** - changes those do not fix a bug or implement a feature. Simple refactoring
* **test** - adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
* **chore** - any other changes, not affecting code
* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)

### Scope
The scope could be anything specifying the place of the commit change. For example core, admin-plugin, translation etc...

### Subject
The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize the first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

### Body
Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer
The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.
