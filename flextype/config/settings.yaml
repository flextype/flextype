# Slim
#
# - display_error_details: When true, additional information about exceptions are
#                          displayed by the default error handler.
#
# - add_content_length_header: When true, Slim will add a Content-Length header to
#                              the response. If you are using a runtime analytics tool,
#                              such as New Relic, then this should be disabled.
#
# - router_cache_file: Filename for caching the FastRoute routes. Must be set to
#                      a valid filename within a writeable directory. If the file
#                      does not exist, then it is created with the correct cache
#                      information on first run. Set to false to disable the FastRoute
#                      cache system.
#
# - determine_route_before_app_middleware: When true, the route is calculated before
#                                          any middleware is executed. This means that you
#                                          can inspect route parameters in middleware if you need to.
#
# - output_buffering: If false, then no output buffering is enabled.
#                     If 'append' or 'prepend', then any echo or print statements
#                     are captured and are either appended or prepended to the Response
#                     returned from the route callable.
#
# - response_chunk_size: Size of each chunk read from the Response body when sending to the browser.
#
# - http_version: The protocol version used by the Response object.
display_error_details: true
add_content_length_header: true

http_version: '1.1'

# Twig
#
# - auto_reload: When developing with Twig, it's useful to recompile the template
#                whenever the source code changes. If you don't provide a value
#                for the auto_reload option, it will be determined automatically
#                based on the debug value.
#
# - debug:       When set to true, the generated templates have a __toString()
#                method that you can use to display the generated nodes
#
# - charset:     The charset used by the templates.
#
# - cache:       Set false to disable caching.
twig:
  auto_reload: true
  cache: true
  debug: false
  charset: "UTF-8"

# Slugify
#
# - separator: By default Slugify will use dashes as separators.
#              If you want to use a different default separator,
#              you can set the separator option.
#
# - lowercase: By default Slugify will convert the slug to lowercase.
#              If you want to preserve the case of the string you can set the
#              lowercase option to false.
#
# - trim:      By default Slugify will remove leading and trailing separators before
#              returning the slug. If you do not want the slug to be trimmed you can
#              set the trim option to false.
#
# - regexp:    You can also change the regular expression that is used to replace
#              characters with the separator.
#
# - lowercase_after_regexp: Lowercasing is done before using the regular expression.
#                           If you want to keep the lowercasing behavior but your
#                           regular expression needs to match uppercase letters,
#                           you can set the lowercase_after_regexp option to true.
#
# - strip_tags: Adds in an option to go through strip_tags() in case the string contains HTML etc.
slugify:
  separator: "-"
  lowercase: true
  trim: true
  regexp: "/[^A-Za-z0-9]+/"
  lowercase_after_regexp: false
  strip_tags: false
