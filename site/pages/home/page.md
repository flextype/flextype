## Flextype is succesfully installed!  
You can start editing the content and customising your site.

### Edit this Page
To edit this page, simply go to the folder you installed Flextype, and then browse to the `/site/pages/home/` folder and open the `page.md` file in your editor.

### Create a New page
Creating a new page is very simple in Flextype.  

1. Launch your text editor and paste this sample text:

    ```
    ---
    title: My New Page
    ---
    # My New Page!

    This is the body of **My New Page**
    ```

2. Save this file in the `/site/pages/my-new-page/` folder as `page.md` and its will be available by this url: http://your_site_url/my-new-page


That is it!
