# Display errors
#
# Please make sure to set false for error `display` in production!
#
# Displaying PHP errors on a public server can be a serious security risk:
#
# - Error messages are displayed with detailed information about the code structure (e.g. file path, class, method)
# - With Whoops enabled, there will be even more detailed information about the code structure
# - Detailed error messages for login failures could leak information to attackers
#
# In a production environment, always log errors to your PHP error logs.
#
# - display: Display errors or not.

# Whoops
#
# Error handler framework for PHP.
#
# - editor: emacs, idea, macvim, phpstorm, sublime, textmate, xdebug, vscode, atom, espresso
#
# - page_title: page title
whoops:
  editor: atom
  page_title: Error!

# Slim
#
# - display_error_details: When true, additional information about exceptions are
#                          displayed by the default error handler.
#
# - add_content_length_header: When true, Slim will add a Content-Length header to
#                              the response. If you are using a runtime analytics tool,
#                              such as New Relic, then this should be disabled.
#
# - router_cache_file: Filename for caching the FastRoute routes. Must be set to
#                      a valid filename within a writeable directory. If the file
#                      does not exist, then it is created with the correct cache
#                      information on first run. Set to false to disable the FastRoute
#                      cache system.
#
# - determine_route_before_app_middleware: When true, the route is calculated before
#                                          any middleware is executed. This means that you
#                                          can inspect route parameters in middleware if you need to.
#
# - output_buffering: If false, then no output buffering is enabled.
#                     If 'append' or 'prepend', then any echo or print statements
#                     are captured and are either appended or prepended to the Response
#                     returned from the route callable.
#
# - response_chunk_size: Size of each chunk read from the Response body when sending to the browser.
#
# - http_version: The protocol version used by the Response object.

# Slugify
#
# - separator: By default Slugify will use dashes as separators.
#              If you want to use a different default separator,
#              you can set the separator option.
#
# - lowercase: By default Slugify will convert the slug to lowercase.
#              If you want to preserve the case of the string you can set the
#              lowercase option to false.
#
# - trim:      By default Slugify will remove leading and trailing separators before
#              returning the slug. If you do not want the slug to be trimmed you can
#              set the trim option to false.
#
# - regexp:    You can also change the regular expression that is used to replace
#              characters with the separator.
#
# - lowercase_after_regexp: Lowercasing is done before using the regular expression.
#                           If you want to keep the lowercasing behavior but your
#                           regular expression needs to match uppercase letters,
#                           you can set the lowercase_after_regexp option to true.
#
# - strip_tags: Adds in an option to go through strip_tags() in case the string contains HTML etc.

# CORS
#
# CORS (Cross-origin resource sharing) allows JavaScript web apps to make HTTP requests to other domains.
# This is important for third party web apps using Flextype, as without CORS, a JavaScript app hosted on example.com
# couldn't access our APIs because they're hosted on another.com which is a different domain.
#
# - enabled: Set to true to enable cors
#
# - origin:   The Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header indicates whether
#             the response can be shared with requesting code from the given origin.
#             read more: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin
#
# - headers:  The Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header is used in response
#             to a preflight request which includes the Access-Control-Request-Headers
#             to indicate which HTTP headers can be used during the actual request.
#             read more: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Headers
#
# - methods: The Access-Control-Allow-Methods response header specifies the method
#            or methods allowed when accessing the resource in response to a preflight request.
#            read more: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Methods
#
# - expose:  The Access-Control-Expose-Headers response header indicates which headers
#            can be exposed as part of the response by listing their names.
#            read more: https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Expose-Headers
#
# - credentials: The Access-Control-Allow-Credentials response header tells browsers whether
#                to expose the response to frontend JavaScript code when the request's credentials
#                mode (Request.credentials) is include.
